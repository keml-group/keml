# KEML (model)

KEML is an [Eclipse EMF project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling.emf.emf) meaning it consists of a set of Eclipse Plugins that create several handy editors and analyzers for KEML files. Each of these parts forms a project of the [KEML group](https://gitlab.uni-koblenz.de/keml). You are currently viewing the **KEML model project**. It basically holds the central definition of the KEML model as an .ecore file.

## Requirements
This project is an Eclipse Modeling project, meaning that it should be opened with [Eclipse Modeling Tools](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2024-03/r/eclipse-modeling-tools). You can add those to an existing Eclipse installation or install them from scratch. More information on this is best retrieved by the eclipse foundation.

## Model

## Background


## Usage and Code Generation

 The two projects edit and editor can be generated in Eclipse just based on this file. Since edit had some customizations, it is recommended to fork it from this GitLab group.


## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.


## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.
